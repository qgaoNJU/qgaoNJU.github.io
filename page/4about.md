2015.9 ~ present Nanjing University Bachelor of Engineering in Microelectronic Science and Engineering
* Major GPA: 4.67/5.00 (rank #1/195); Overall GPA: 4.6/5.0 (rank #1/47 #3/195)
* Research Interests: DSP; wireless communication;hardware-aware machine learning

## Research Experience

*10/2017–11/2018 Undergraduate Research Assistant,School of Electronic Science and Engineering,Nanjing University*
* Mentors: IEEE Fellow Professor Zhongfeng Wang and Dr. Jun Lin
* Led a national undergraduate innovation project “High Precision Face Recognition via Deep Learning Algorithms”
* Conducted training, evaluation, quantization, and finetuning of face-detection model MTCNN(multitask cascaded convolution neural network) 
* Executed hardware realization of MTCNN on PYNQ (Python ZYNQ) embedded platform
* Achieved superior accuracy on FDDB benchmarks for face detection
* Compressed MTCNN model size to a quarter by quantizing weights and activations to be 8-bit fixed-point numbers
* Recovered model accuracy, through quantization-aware training, by 9%, quite close to that of the float-point model
* Replaced TensorFlow functions in MTCNN with pure Python codes and realized face detection on PYNQ

*10/2017–09/2018 Research Intern, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,University of California, Los Angeles*
* Mentors: Professor Y. Ethan Wang and Dr. Rui Zhu
* Implemented MATLAB simulation of active filtering scheme to address quantization noise in bitstream transmitters based on envelope delta-sigma modulation (EDSM)
* Examined delay time of different power channels and its effects on active filter characteristics
* Demonstrated experiments using Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) and ArbExpress software
* Designed power combiner structure to recycle rejected noise power and improve overall power efficiency
* Proposed to use DPD (digital predistortion) techniques to compensate for signal degradation in active filtering 

*07/2016–05/2017 Undergraduate Research Assistant, School of Electronic Science and Engineering,Nanjing University*
* Mentor: Professor Yun Li 
* Conducted primary source research at numerous archives, reviewing publications on solution-processed organic transistors
* Characterized morphology and crystalline properties of 2D C8-BTBT layers via AFM
* Confirmed that the rapid operations in the Fe-OFETs were attributed to the efficient charge injection by virtue of the ultrathin 2D films
